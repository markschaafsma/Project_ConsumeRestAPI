# Sample Python Project - Call REST API and Load Database

## Purpose

This project includes some modules from a work application I wrote.

The purpose is to show some of the code I've written and provided an indication of my capability.

Only a subset of application modules have been added to the repository. That is, the application is
incomplete, so it will not interpret or run.

Likewise it has been anonymised.

The function of the application is to call a REST API to retrieve data in JSON format, validate 
the data, and then either insert new data or update existing data in a relational database.

## Project Structure

Project modules are placed within the following structure:

 - Project
   - control
   - database
   - models
   - sqlscripts
   - tests
   - utilities
